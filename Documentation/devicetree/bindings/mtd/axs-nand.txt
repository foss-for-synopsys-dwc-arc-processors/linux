* Synopsys AXS NAND controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "snps,axs-nand"
  - reg: physical base address and size of the registers map

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

flash@0x16000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "snps,axs-nand";
	reg = < 0x16000 0x200 >;
};
