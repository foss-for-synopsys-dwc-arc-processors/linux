Synopsys DesignWare APB GPIO controller used as interrupt controller
(dw_apb_gpio_intc)

Synopsys DesignWare provides a GPIO controller IP for APB, that has one bank
that can be configured to be used as an interrupt controller.

Note that for every input interrupt, there is also an output interrupt. SoC
designers may choose to logically OR the outcoming interrupts before they
enter the parent interrupt controller, but this is not required. To keep
things simple, the driver checks all pending interrupts for each different
interrupt at the parent (i.e. behaviour is the same, no matter what parent
interrupt is triggered).

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "snps,dw-apb-gpio-intc"
- reg: base address of interrupt registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: number of cells to encode an interrupt source, shall be 1
- interrupts: interrupts that reference to the primary interrupt controller
- interrupt-parent: (optional) reference specific primary interrupt controller

The interrupt sources map to the corresponding bits in the interrupt
registers, i.e.
- 0 maps to bit 0 of interrupts,
- 1 maps to bit 1 of interrupts, etc.

Example:
	gpio_intc: interrupt-controller@3000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-gpio-intc";
		reg = <0x3000 0x80>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&cpu_intc>;
		interrupts = <5 6 7 8 9>;
	};
